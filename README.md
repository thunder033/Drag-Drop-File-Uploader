# File-Drop
File-Drop is an AJAX driven file upload widget with the following features:

- User friendly interface
- Multiple drag-and-drop file uploads
- Ability to set upload folder, allowed file types, and max upload size
- Custom upload callbacks and can intercept file uploads for additional handling
- Allows a maximum number of files to be uploaded
- Progress Bar for each file upload
- Backwards compatiblility to IE 7
- Preview of uploaded image files
- File tracking by ID
 
File-Drop does rely on jQuery, but other than, it is self contained.

The PHP backend is somehwat lacking, becuase this was originally deployed on a Rails server.

See test.html for example of how to create and initiate FileDrop.
